This is a TODO file.  I will be checking things off as they get
implemented.

- There are a bunch of issues, both resolved and outstanding, that
  depend on RT functionality, i.e. to verify them one needs access
  to working RT installation.  It is also likely that parts of RT
  behavior change a little from release to release.  I think it would
  be a great help to create a test file that tests manupulation of
  actual RT tickets with an instance of RT in the backend.

- We need a simple way to create a local instance of RT.

- Fetch forms from RT and verify CFs etc. based on that on the client
  side because of RT REST's non-atomicity -- i.e. some fields/values
  will go through correctly, while others will give syntax/permission
  errors.

  Based on discussion with Jesse Vincent (obra) on #rt@irc.perl.org
  on 7/25/2006.

- Write user manual.
